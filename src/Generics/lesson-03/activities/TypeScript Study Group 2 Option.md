# Practical TypeScript Exercises for Frontend and Backend Developers

## Module 1: Working with Data Structures

### Exercise 1.1: Creating a User Interface
- **Task:** Define an interface `User` with properties `id` (number), `username` (string), and `email` (string).
- **Objective:** Practice creating interfaces for typical user data.

### Exercise 1.2: Implementing an Address Book
- **Task:** Extend the `User` interface to include an array of contacts, using a `Contact` interface that contains a `name` (string), `phone` (string), and an optional `email` (string).
- **Objective:** Understand how to work with arrays in interfaces and the use of optional properties.

## Module 2: Enhancing Functionality with Types

### Exercise 2.1: Function for User Creation
- **Task:** Write a function `createUser` that takes a `User` object as an argument and returns a new user with an autogenerated `id`.
- **Objective:** Apply interfaces in function arguments and return types.

### Exercise 2.2: Type Guards for User Validation
- **Task:** Implement a type guard function `isUser` that checks if an object is a `User`.
- **Objective:** Learn to use type guards to validate custom types at runtime.

## Module 3: Advanced Type Manipulation

### Exercise 3.1: Mapping Types for API Responses
- **Task:** Use mapped types to create a `ReadOnlyUser` type from the `User` interface, where all properties are read-only.
- **Objective:** Explore advanced type manipulation with mapped types.

### Exercise 3.2: Conditional Types for API Utilities
- **Task:** Write a utility type `Optional<T>` that transforms all properties of type `T` into optional properties.
- **Objective:** Practice creating and using conditional types.

## Module 4: Working with Generics

### Exercise 4.1: Generic Data Fetching Function
- **Task:** Create a generic async function `fetchData<T>` that fetches data from a given URL and returns a promise with data of type `T`.
- **Objective:** Apply generics to asynchronous functions and promises for flexible API calls.

### Exercise 4.2: Generic Interface for API Responses
- **Task:** Define a generic interface `ApiResponse<T>` that contains `data` of type `T`, a `status` code (number), and an optional `errorMessage` (string).
- **Objective:** Learn to structure API responses using generics for flexible error handling and data retrieval.

## Module 5: Practical Application Scenarios

### Exercise 5.1: Creating a Todo List Interface
- **Task:** Design an interface `TodoItem` with `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`, and `createdAt` properties. Create a type `TodoList` as an array of `TodoItem`.
- **Objective:** Model real-world data structures, focusing on CRUD operations.

### Exercise 5.2: Utility Function for Todo List Filtering
- **Task:** Write a function `filterTodos` that takes a `TodoList` and a criterion (e.g., completed status) and returns a filtered list based on the criterion.
- **Objective:** Combine interfaces, types, and functions to manipulate and query data structures.

### Exercise 5.3: Enhancing the Todo List with Generics
- **Task:** Extend the `TodoList` to support generic filtering criteria, not limited to predefined properties of `TodoItem`.
- **Objective:** Use generics to create flexible and reusable data manipulation utilities.
